#  User Management Tool

A **Linux system administration tool** written in **Bash** that allows administrators to manage user accounts directly from the terminal with an interactive menu.  
This project showcases **System Administrator skills** such as user creation, account locking, unlocking, deletion, and password management.

##  Getting Started

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanmarkos/user_management.git
cd user_management
```
### Make the script executable
```
chmod +x user_management.sh
```
### Run the tool (requires root/sudo privileges)
```
sudo ./user_management.sh
```

Only root/sudo users can run this script.

New users are created with Zsh shell by default (Kali-style prompt).

Users are forced to change their password at first login.

Logging ensures an audit trail for all actions.
